	<div>India is a country with a mixture of a variety of castes, religions, cultures and tradition. There are many things to read about India, which we have brought through a few paragraphs below. All these paragraphs have a different word limit and prepared in easy language.</div>

	<div>India is one of the 195 countries in the world. It has many names like Hindustan, Bharat, Aryavarta and Jambudvipa. Hindi is the mother tongue of India. The constitution of India is the supreme law book in India. It is the longest written constitution of the world.</div>

	<div>The Indian Flag consists of three colours saffron, white and green. People used to call India 'A Golden Bird' because of the richness of natural resources here. India is a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic country. The preamble of the Indian Constitution verifies this statement. As an Indian, we are proud of our nation.</div>

	<div>India is one of the developing countries of the world. The earliest civilization started here from Indus Valley Civilization in the north-west of India. India is rich in ancient cultural heritages available here. Researchers believe that India is the place where the earliest civilization has started. India is perhaps the only country in the world with so many festivals in a year. There is a festival on almost every day of the year.</div>

	<div>India is the second-largest country as per the population after China. The Independence Day of India, The Republic Day of India and Gandhi Jayanti are the three national festivals of India. Our national anthem is our identity. We should respect it and sing with patriotism and pride.</div>

	<div>India is a part of Asia, one of the five continents of the World. Its history begins with the pre-Vedic period, but the written documents are available from the Vedic period. The Vedas and Upanishads reveal many mysteries about India. Our ancient scriptures say that India used to be the reserve of all the important and precious natural resources.</div>

	<div>The British Government, anyhow, managed to come to India and capture all its property. They ruled India for almost 200 years. Some Indian patriots could not bear it, and they revolted against the British Government. The struggle took many lives, and finally, India achieved freedom on 15th of August 1947.</div>

	<div>India needed its constitution to form a government. The Constitution of India came into force on 26th January 1950. These two events from Indian history are the most important events, and we celebrate them as Independence Day and Republic Day of India.</div>

	<div>India is one of the prominent countries of the World. Area wise, it is the World's seventh-largest country with an approximate area of 32, 87,263 km square. India has such a diverse geography, unlike other countries. The land boundary of Indian is about 15106.7 km long. It touches the boundaries of 7 important countries as Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Apart from these, Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the other two neighbouring countries of India.</div>

	<div>The highest range of mountain on Earth, Himalaya is situated on the north of India. Mount Everest, situated in the Himalayan range, is the tallest mountain in the World. Some of its famous ranges are Satpura, Vindhya, Aravali and Shivalik.</div>

	<div>The three major water bodies of the World surround India from the three sides. The Indian Ocean is in the south while the Arabian Sea is on the west of India. The Bay of Bengal covers India from the east. These three together provide India with the advantage of maritime trade. India has only one dessert, and that is 'The Thar Dessert' or 'Marusthal'. These geographical variations in India cause different weathers throughout the year. India has six seasons throughout the year.</div>

	<div>India is widely famous for having the highest cultural diversity in the World. It is almost impossible for even Indians to visit and explore every culture residing in India. The variety of cultures in India attracts people from the world to visit here at least once in their life.</div>

	<div>Among the religions in the world, most of them are available in India. Some famous of them are Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam and Zoroastrianism. Hinduism and Buddhism have born in India.</div>

	<div>There are 28 States and 8 Union Territories in India. They all have their different cultures and traditions. The people in India speak more than a hundred languages, and 22 of them have a tag of official languages of India. English is an official language of India. Also, India stands among the few English speaking countries in the World. It is not less than pride for us.</div>

	<div>Since India is a secular country, therefore every religion here is treated equally. Every individual in India has equal rights irrespective to religion. Also, every Indian is free to move any part of the country without any documentation. The holy books of Hinduism 'Vedas' and 'Upanishads' are the ancient books of India depicting its history.</div>

	<div>India is one among the fastest-growing economies of the World. Agriculture is the main basis of the Indian economy. About 60% of the Indian population earns its livelihood through agriculture and other types of farming. We, as an Indian, strongly believe in 'unity in diversity'.</div>
